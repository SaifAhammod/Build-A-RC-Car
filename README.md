## 🚗 Overview
This project showcases a **Bluetooth-controlled RC car** that can be operated using an Android app. The car's movements are controlled via an **Arduino** microcontroller, which communicates with the app using a Bluetooth module.

### ✨ Features
- **Wireless Control**: Use a smartphone app to control the car.
- **Easy Assembly**: Simple circuit and body design for DIY enthusiasts.
- **Arduino-Based**: Open-source and easily customizable.
- **Bluetooth Connectivity**: Seamless communication between app and car.
